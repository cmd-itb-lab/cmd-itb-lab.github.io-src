In order to understand the machinery of a density functional theory calculations we need to
know how to solve Kohn-Sham equations. From practical point of view, Kohn-Sham equations
consist of coupled Schrodinger and Poisson equations.

In the following notebooks I describe how to use simple finite difference method
to solve Schrodinger equation in 2d for several simple potentials.
